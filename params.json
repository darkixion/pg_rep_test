Each standby would be configured\r\nto connect to the first standby, and the first standby would connect\r\nto the primary.\r\n\r\nThis would also produce the following ASCII-diagram which displays the\r\nconfiguration they were created in and the port numbers used:\r\n\r\n\t[Primary (5530)]\r\n\t    |\r\n\t    ---[Standby 1 (5531)]\r\n\t            |\r\n\t            ---[Standby 2 (5532)]\r\n\t            |\r\n\t            ---[Standby 3 (5533)]\r\n\t            |\r\n\t            ---[Standby 4 (5534)]\r\n\t            |\r\n\t            ---[Standby 5 (5535)]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nYou can run pg_rep_test without any parameters which will then just create a primary\r\nwith a single standby.\r\n\r\nIf a list of ports isn't specified, it will use a list of unused ports starting from\r\n5530.  If a port is in use, the next port will be checked and so on, until every\r\ninstance has a port it can use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\npg_rep_test is licensed under The PostgreSQL License\r\n(http://www.opensource.org/licenses/postgresql),\r\nwhich is closely related to the BSD license.\r\n","google":"UA-40085049-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
